#Hyper Ajax Object

The HyperAjaxObject Class is written in PHP and designed to make loading dynamic ajax content a snap. Don't worry if you are not familiar with Javascript, the class takes care of all of that client side code for you. Just copy and paste a few simple PHP method calls and you will have taken your first step into the world of the dynamic web. 2.0 I think they call it. ~ System created by Adam J Nowak
